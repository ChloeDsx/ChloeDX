            I started crochet 6 months ago, when I saw in a market some crochet keychain. I thought "Wow, maybe I can do that".
            <br>At first, it was difficult especially because I learnt it on my own, in my room.
            <br>Eventualy, I got the hang of it and now I can do a lot of things. I can do keychains, bags, hats, scarfs, etc.
            <br>You can do it too, it's not that hard ! You are trying to learn how to code, so you definitely have the patience to learn crochet.
