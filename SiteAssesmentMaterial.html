        <ul id="main_content">
            <li>Crochets. There are a lot of size available but the smaller the size, the harder it is. For me, size 5mm is the easiest to start.</li>
            <li>Yarn. There are a lot of type of yarns to, different size, colors etc. To start I would recommend coton as it tends to be easier to knit. You can see the size of the hook you need to yarn no the label of the yarn.</li>
            <li>Some stitch marker. At first it will be really handy to be sure you have made the right amount of stitches in each row</li>
            <li>Yarning needles. You will need them to hide the yarn at the end of your project.</li>
            <li>Cissors. You will often have to cut you yarn, it's easier to have it with you at all time.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are so much more items you can buy to make your crochet experience easier and more fun. But with those 5 items, you can start and make a lot of things.
